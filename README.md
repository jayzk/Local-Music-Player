# Locafy
Locafy is a desktop music player designed to help you easily manage and store your local music collection. With an integrated YouTube downloader powered by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file), you can seamlessly download and enjoy your favorite tracks directly from YouTube.

# Installation
To install Locafy, download the [setup binary]((https://github.com/jayzk/Local-Music-Player/releases)) and run the installer to get started.

# Technologies
Locafy was built using Electron and Vite. Electron enables us to harness the power of web technologies like HTML, CSS, and TypeScript for creating cross-platform desktop applications. Node.js handles the backend functionality, while SQLite serves as the local database. The frontend is developed using React and Tailwind, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. To enhance development speed and efficiency, we used Vite, which streamlined the build process and provided faster updates during development.

# TO-DO list for Locafy
- Fix cross-platform support

- Add more search capabilities
